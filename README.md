Enigma I PowerShell simulator

This is an Enigma I simulator I wrote, after seeing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybkkiGtJmkM) wonderfull animation by Jared Owen. It simulates the most common Enigma type, Wehrmacht Enigma I with 5 possible rotors.

I am not a programmer and I was learing as I was typing, so I am sorry if the code is poorly written. Feel free to improve the code. I used a PowerShell ISE, one thing already there in Windows.

This version does not have a GUI, it just converts an input string to an encoded string, given the encoding parameters. I have used this code to write a GUI version, see [EnigmaPS](https://github.com/longarivero/EnigmaPS).
